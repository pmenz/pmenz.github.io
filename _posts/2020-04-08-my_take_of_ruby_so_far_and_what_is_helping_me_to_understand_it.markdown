Before I started learning Ruby I knew it maybe one or two coding languages. Pascal and Visual where Pascal is 

generally old and apparently obsolete and well Visual didnâ€™t really count as a coding language, so getting to learn Ruby

with that background it wasn't as smooth as I thought it would be. But, with certainty I can tell I started off pretty good

with understanding the basics of Ruby like its Body, Methods, Operatos, Loops, Iterators and other elements, but 

eventually it became more abstract and challenging, and with challenging I mean `classes` and `objects` and in Ruby 

everything, yes everything is an `object`, so keep that in mind. But do not panic because there is plenty of material out

there that can help you understand it. 





**This were all the things I did that helped me :**

* Getting into forums and posting every single question [ruby-forum]( http://www.ruby-forum.com)

*  Using codewars to get more familiar with the syntax of Ruby [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com) 

*  Watching videos, Youtube has some really amazing videos. This one helped me with classes and objects [best intro to classes!](http://https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc5RhTIBf4c&t=4s)
* Pairing with someone and try to get some labs done together. 

*  Not copying/pasting Code, this will help you to get the flex you need! 

*  and lastly repel.it
