This is how it all started.
Since I was a kid I loved being around technology whether it was gaming consoles (Nintendo in my case), computers, programmable calculators, or phones. Unfortunately, growing up and having to choose a career, my insecurities took me away from what I wanted to do and I ended up studying Engineering. 

Now that I have established a life for myself and I found the opportunity to work on something I'm passionate about. I will try to give my all into achieving this goal.
